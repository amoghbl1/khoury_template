# PhD Dissertation/Proposal Template

This repo is a tex template adapted from the College of Engineering MS Thesis/PhD Dissertation template, which in turn was based on the `ucthesis` template.

A lot of the code here comes from these previous versions.
The main changes this version includes are adding support for proposals, and redefining the way you add committee members. Also includes minor changes to the "Abstract" page.

Please refer the `thesis.tex` and `proposal.tex` files for inline comments on using the template.
